# Remora-V2
I'm working on REMORA, a tiny sensor node that attaches through magnets or micro suction material (research yet to be done here) to machinery (or even RC planes) to log vibration, acceleration, rotation, and impact data. The goal is to create a low-cost alternative to expensive monitoring equipment and is lightweight enough to mount anywhere.
